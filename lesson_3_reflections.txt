When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to use a remote repository when collaborating with other devs or if you would like to access your repository from other machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The main reason why you would want to pull manually is because the changes you made might not be ready to be made final.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are for copying inside of GitHub, wereas clones are done locally or from GitHub to a local machine. Branches are compartments of a repository off of the master branch to test code that you don't want on your master yet or to add a language, etc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote is to see whether your repository is up-to-date and you can compare the changes you have made.

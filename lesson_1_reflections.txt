How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I was able to see what lines of code were diff between versions and make changes if need be.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You would have the ability to look back at old versions of your program to see how you have progressed or find working code in previous versions to use in new versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Manually saving commits gives you more flexability whereas auto saving will give you messed up results.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
In Git multiple files make up one app so it would make sense to save them in one commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log lists the recent commits and git diff lets you compare two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Version control gives you the ability to  revert to previous versions of your code to debug your code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Making an Android app.

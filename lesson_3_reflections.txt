When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to use a remote repository when collaborating with other devs or if you would like to access your repository from other machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The main reason why you would want to pull manually is because the changes you made might not be ready to be made final.
